# Stellar
 Stellar Classification using SDSS17 Dataset

## Steps followed:
### EDA
- Visual EDA
- Univariate Statistical Analysis
- Multivariate statistical analysis

### Data Processing
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Selection

### Modeling
##### Preliminary Model using 5 modeling techniques
- Target class labeling
- Class Balancing using SMOTE and random Undersampler
- Polynimial Features addition
- Building a pipeline object for a small preliminary grid search for optimal parameters.

### Evaluation
Using the model accuracy for cross-validation, training and testing sets. Also looked at idividual class F1 scores to assess the errors.
